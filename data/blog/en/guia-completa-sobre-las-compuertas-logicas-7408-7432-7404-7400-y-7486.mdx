Have you ever wondered how the electronic devices you use daily work? The answer lies in **[logic gates](/en/compuertas-logicas)**, the fundamental components in any digital circuit. In this article, we will explore some of the most common logic gates: 7408, 7432, 7404, 7400, and 7486. Understanding these components is crucial for any electronics enthusiast.

In addition to these main gates, there are also others such as [NOR (7402)](/en/compuertas-logicas/7402), [XNOR (74266)](/en/compuertas-logicas/74266), and [Buffer (7407)](/en/compuertas-logicas/7407), all available in our interactive simulator.

## What are Logic Gates?

**Logic gates** are basic building blocks of digital electronics that perform Boolean operations on one or more binary inputs to produce a binary output. These components are essential in creating complex digital circuits and are used to build everything from calculators to computers and communication systems.

## Common Logic Gates and Their Characteristics

### AND Gate (7408)

![Datasheet AND Gate 7408 - Integrated Circuit 74LS08](/static/images/74LS08.jpg)

The **[7408 gate](/en/compuertas-logicas/7408)** is a 2-input AND gate. For the output of this gate to be high (1), both inputs must be high (1).

- **Configuration**: 2 inputs and 1 output.
- **Truth Table**:

| Input A | Input B | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 0      |
| 1       | 0       | 0      |
| 1       | 1       | 1      |

### OR Gate (7432)

The **[7432 gate](/en/compuertas-logicas/7432)** is a 2-input OR gate. The output will be high (1) if at least one of the inputs is high (1).

- **Configuration**: 2 inputs and 1 output.
- **Truth Table**:

| Input A | Input B | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 1      |
| 1       | 1       | 1      |

### NOT Gate (7404)

The **[7404 gate](/en/compuertas-logicas/7404)** is a NOT gate, also known as an inverter. It has a single input and a single output, inverting the logical state of the input.

- **Configuration**: 1 input and 1 output.
- **Truth Table**:

| Input | Output |
| ----- | ------ |
| 0     | 1      |
| 1     | 0      |

### NAND Gate (7400)

![Datasheet NAND Gate 7400 - Integrated Circuit 74LS00](/static/images/74LS00.jpg)

The **[7400 gate](/en/compuertas-logicas/7400)** is a 2-input NAND gate. It is a combination of the AND and NOT gates. The output will be low (0) only when both inputs are high (1).

- **Configuration**: 2 inputs and 1 output.
- **Truth Table**:

| Input A | Input B | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0       | 1      |
| 0       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 1      |
| 1       | 1       | 0      |

### XOR Gate (7486)

![Datasheet XOR Gate 7486 - Integrated Circuit 74LS86](/static/images/74LS86.jpg)

The **[7486 gate](/en/compuertas-logicas/7486)** is a 2-input XOR gate. The output will be high (1) if only one of the inputs is high (1).

- **Configuration**: 2 inputs and 1 output.
- **Truth Table**:

| Input A | Input B | Output |
| ------- | ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0       | 0      |
| 0       | 1       | 1      |
| 1       | 0       | 1      |
| 1       | 1       | 0      |

## How Logic Gates Work

### Active High and Active Low

Understanding the concept of **active high and active low** is essential when working with [logic gates](/en/compuertas-logicas). An active low pin must be connected to a low logic level (0 volts) to be activated, while an active high pin must be connected to a high logic level (3 or 5 volts).

### Implementation in Integrated Circuits (ICs)

[Logic gates](/en/compuertas-logicas) are implemented in **integrated circuits (ICs)** to save space and increase efficiency. For example, the 7408 IC contains four [AND gates](/en/compuertas-logicas/7408) with two inputs on a single chip.

### Complex Operations

By combining different [logic gates](/en/compuertas-logicas), complex operations can be performed. For example, a flip-flop, which is used to store data, can be built by combining [NAND gates](/en/compuertas-logicas/7400).

If you want to **experiment with these gates** and see how they work in practice, you can use our [interactive logic gates simulator](/en/compuertas-logicas) where you can build virtual circuits and observe the behavior of each gate in real time.
